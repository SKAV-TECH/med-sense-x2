2. Diagnostic Tests:

   - Follow-up culture if symptoms persist after 3 days

3. Lifestyle Recommendations:
   - Rest for 48-72 hours
   - Increased fluid intake (minimum 2-3 liters daily)
   - Avoid strenuous activity for one week

4. Follow-up:
   - Virtual check-in after 3 days
   - In-person follow-up in 2 weeks if symptoms resolved
   - Immediate contact if shortness of breath, high fever (>102Â°F), or severe pain develops

5. Additional Considerations:
   - Monitor for medication side effects, especially gastrointestinal discomfort
